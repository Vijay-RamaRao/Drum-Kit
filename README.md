# Drum Kit ðŸŽ¶

This is my first JavaScript project! ðŸš€ It's an interactive **Drum Kit** application where you can play drum sounds by either clicking on the on-screen buttons or pressing specific keys on your keyboard.

## Features:
- **Responsive Drum Buttons**: Each button represents a different drum sound, styled with custom backgrounds for an engaging look.
- **Keyboard Support**: Play sounds using the keys `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `J`, `K`, and `L`.
- **Interactive Animation**: Buttons flash with a visual effect when pressed, enhancing the user experience.
- **Audio Integration**: Real drum sounds are played for a realistic feel.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for interactivity and event handling

## Learning Outcomes:
Through this project, I learned:
- How to handle **DOM events** like `click` and `keydown`.
- Implementing animations by dynamically adding and removing CSS classes.
- Using the **Audio API** to play sounds in the browser.

## How to Use:
1. Open the project in a browser.
2. Click the drum buttons or press the corresponding keys (`W`, `A`, `S`, `D`, `J`, `K`, `L`) to produce drum sounds.
3. Watch the buttons light up when pressed for a fun, interactive experience!
